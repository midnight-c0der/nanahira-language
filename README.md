# Nanahira language
maybe you're thinking "a compiler, written in javascript? really? are you stupid?", and yeah but:
* once it's all compiled runtime is the same, and i plan on making compilation zoomzoom fast
* i also plan on rewriting the compiler in this language once its ready

it currently supports basic computation, functions, arrays, inline asm and syscalls
it is possible to write a (somewhat janky) hello world program

might rename it at some point to someone/something, havent decided yet  
imagine having a whole programming language and compiler dedicated to you  
that's like, the highest honor
