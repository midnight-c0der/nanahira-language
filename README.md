# Nanahira language
maybe you're thinking "a compiler, written in javascript? really? are you stupid?", and yeah but:
* once it's all compiled runtime is the same, and i plan on making compilation zoomzoom fast
* i also plan on rewriting the compiler in this language once its ready

it currently supports basic computation, functions, arrays, if statements, while loops, and inline asm  
input.txt has an example program which converts an integer to a string and also demonstrates printing multiple times with a for loop

might rename it at some point to someone/something, havent decided yet  
imagine having a whole programming language and compiler dedicated to you  
that's like, the highest honor
