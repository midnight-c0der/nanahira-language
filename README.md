# Nanahira language
maybe you're thinking "a compiler, written in javascript? really? are you stupid?", and yeah but:
* once it's all compiled runtime is the same, and i plan on making compilation zoomzoom fast
* i also plan on rewriting the compiler in this language once its ready

features:
* functions
* arrays (currently limited to 1 dimension)
* basic control flow (if, for, while)
* importing different files
* inline asm
* world's smallest standard library consisting of strlen and print

source files go in source directory with extension .txt (dont wanna lock myself into a specific extension yet)  
compiled asm goes into output directory  
will need to assemble and link it yourself

might rename it at some point to someone/something, havent decided yet  
imagine having a whole programming language and compiler dedicated to you  
that's like, the highest honor
